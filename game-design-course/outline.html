<div class="entry"><em>Course Objectives</em>

<p>Welcome to MEDIAART 3L03: Game Design, a course in which we will explore game technologies in a hands-on way, using them to create video games both individually and collectively. This is how the course is described in the McMaster undergraduate calendar for 2022-23: “Students will develop designs and assets for digital games, informed by readings and discussions of game design theory.”</p>

<p>This will be the 67th course I have led as a university instructor, and my 5th time teaching this particular course, which I first proposed as new addition to the Media Arts (then “Multimedia”) program back in 2013, teaching it for the first time in 2014-15. My motivation to champion this course is rooted in the perception that making games is (1) an amazing vehicle for exploration and learning in Media Arts, and (2) a milieu full of diverse career/life possibilities for students, and (3) a way of deepening my own engagement with games, game studies, and game making. I am very much looking forward to what we will make together over the next three months! For this year’s version of the course, I am hoping we will be able to develop a collective and non-exclusive focus on games and the environment/games and ecology.</p>
    
<p>During the second half of the semester, we’ll work together as a unified team on a single, collective game project, producing a more substantial game than any of us could achieve individually in such a short time frame. We’ll aim to share this game widely: with the McMaster campus, with the wider community of students working on game projects at multiple institutions around this corner of Lake Ontario (via the annual <a href="https://levelupshowcase.com/"></a>Level Up Showcase</a>), and as free software on the Internet. Our weekly meetings in the second half of the semester will be entirely devoted to working together on this collective project (substantial independent work on this project between meetings will also be required).</p>
    
<p>Leading up to that, our work in the first half of the course will be focused on developing what we’ll need, individually, for our collectively-made game. We’ll develop theoretical vocabulary to describe the features of video games and their design/development processes, and consider how social difference plays out in games and game design. We’ll produce “game assets” (such as game-ready 3D models, images, and sounds) and incorporate them into game engine projects, and explore implementing different types of game rules or “mechanics”. We’ll get to know each other, get used to working together, and develop our readiness to share ideas about game elements.</p>
    
<p>To become and remain an effective team, we need to show up for each other as much as possible, including by attending full-class meetings from the beginning to the end. But please don’t attend when you are feeling ill NOR when there are compelling circumstances that mean that you would not be able to contribute meaningfully to those meetings (e.g., personal/family emergencies, mental health crises, challenges meeting basic needs such as food or shelter, etc). You don’t need to explain such absences to me, although if you feel it would help to talk to me about it, I’m certainly here for that.</p>
    
<p>I’ll establish a Discord server for the class (invite link on Avenue, not to be shared with folks outside our class), and encourage everyone to join it and use it to communicate in between class meetings (<a href="https://discord.com/privacy">here is Discord’s privacy policy</a>). Discord is the recommended way of submitting the Brief Analysis of a Game Detail assignment during the first half of the course, and will be especially helpful as we move into the fully collaborative collective game project. Please ensure that your handle on the class Discord server reflects the preferred way that we should call you, so that we all know who is who (Discord allows you to set a specific name for a specific server, by the way).</p>
    
<p>I also strongly encourage you to visit me during my office hours (Fridays during the hour before and after our full-class meeting). I’m happy to talk about anything related to this course, and I’m also happy to talk about other things as well (e.g. games, music, careers, graduate school, etc)!</p>
</div>

<div class="entry"><em>Textbooks, Materials, & Fees</em>
<p>You DON’T need to buy any books or texts. Some of the texts we’ll refer to are already freely available on the open web, and I may make some other texts available inside Avenue on a fair use basis.</p>

<p>We’ll be using two pieces of free-and-open-source software heavily: <a href="https://godotengine.org">the Godot game engine</a> (version 4.3-stable, standard NOT mono) and the 3D modeling software known as <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/lts/4-2/">Blender (version 4.2 LTS). This software will be installed and available in the Media Arts wing. If you expect to work on your own computer as well, you’ll need to install the exact versions of both of these software packages on your computer.</p>

<p>You DO need to sign up for keycard access to the Media Arts wing (TSH-202B), equipment reservation system, and surround sound studio. This requires the purchase of a key card for $10.00 (non-refundable, charged to your student account) in TSH 209 between 8:00am-12:00pm and 1:00pm-4:00pm Monday to Friday (times subject to change, see <a href="https://hmcservicecentre.humanities.mcmaster.ca/">https://hmcservicecentre.humanities.mcmaster.ca/</a> for further details). Please sign up for this as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The use of an external three-button mouse (i.e. one that you plug into your computer with a USB cable and can move separately from the computer) is strongly recommended during this course, especially when working with Blender.</p>
</div>
 

<div class="entry"><em>Method of Assessment</em>

<p>Assessment in this course works in a different way than what you might be used to. For a few years now I have been exploring what is sometimes called “alternative grading”, and my experiences with it continue to convince me that it is a profoundly positive thing. Here are the four principles guiding my evolving approach to assessment: 
<ul>
    <li>Clear Standards: We should have a high level of clarity about how work meets or does not yet meet standards for the course, and about how a specific final grade is earned.</li>

    <li>Epistemic Peace: The standards are narrowly defined (a.k.a. “technical”), so that you are free to submit work whose motivations and aesthetic choices might be quite different than my own.</li>

    <li>Feedback Loops: Work that does not yet meet a standard can and should be resubmitted.</li>

    <li>Accessibility: Short-term difficulties (such as situations connected to disability, illness, emergencies, workload, etc) present no obstacle to earning the full range of available grades.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Here’s how it works concretely. There are three basic things everyone in the class needs to do, and successfully fulfilling all three of these basic expectations in a timely way earns a “base grade” of 9 (B+) on McMaster’s 12-point scale: 
<ul>
    <li>Demonstrate at least level 1 competency in ALL 5 areas of Technical Practice, prior to the beginning of the collective game project (more details below)</li>

    <li>Submit a small, complete, playable, individually created game, AND share it with the class at our individual game showcase (more details below)</li>

    <li>Contribute regularly and substantially to our collective game project, AND submit a portfolio documenting your individual contributions (more details below)</li>
</ul>
</p>
 
<p>In the hopefully unlikely event that someone doesn’t meet one or more of the three basic expectations, the base grade of 9 would be reduced by 3 points (a letter grade) for each expectation that was not met. The grade would also be reduced by 1 point for each basic expectation that is “almost but not quite met”, including when the work is acceptable but arrives too late to fully contribute to our collective discussion and deliberation.</p>

<p>I strongly encourage you to aim to complete work above and beyond these basic expectations. Such work will be rewarded with a higher grade. Specifically, you can earn a grade above 9 (B+) through the addition of a single point on McMaster’s 12-point scale (to a maximum of 12) for each of the following: 
<ul>
    <li>Attend at least 9 out of 11 in-person full-class meetings from beginning to end AND contribute a Brief Analysis of a Game Detail to our class discussion (more details below)</li>

    <li>Demonstrate level 3 competency in one of the 5 areas of technical practice</li>

    <li>Demonstrate level 2 competency in another one of the 5 areas of technical practice</li>

    <li>Be recognized by the instructor (me) for “above and beyond” contributions throughout our collective game project</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Accommodation for absences from part or all of class meetings (for any and all reasons) has been “baked in, in advance, universally” to this assessment structure in two ways: (1) A strong record of attendance is not the only way to earn the highest possible grade; and (2) there is no grading difference between attending 9, 10, or 11 full-class meetings. No further grading accommodation of absence is possible, strictly. Absences could also impact your ability to deliver on other course expectations, such as making regular and salient contributions to our collective game project. Please reach out as soon as possible in such cases so that we can strategize together about how to work around the impact of any necessary absences on the other concrete expectations of this course.</p>

<p>Since it might seem unusual or unfamiliar, we’ll discuss some grading scenarios during our first full-class meeting, and we’ll continue to check in about how everything is going as the semester progresses. Please reach out to me at any time if you are unsure about how any of this works! And please rest assured there will be plenty of qualitative feedback in the course (from me, from each other), beyond the mechanical questions of credit and grades addressed by this grading system.</p>

<p><em>Technical Practice</em>: The 5 areas of technical practice we’ll explore in this course are 3D assets, 2D user interfaces (UI), Sound, Mechanics, and Camera/Control. One of the basic expectations in the course is that you will achieve at least level 1 (of 3 possible levels) in ALL 5 areas of technical practice, and achieving level 2 or 3 is encouraged and recognized by earning higher grades in the course. Although there’s no special technical area for Level Design, we’ll also explore that as part of our technical practice, since the way you demonstrate competence in a technical area is through submitting a playable game that demonstrates the relevant technical concepts. Typically, this would be a very small game submitted during or shortly after our weekly class meetings (and no later than 10 PM) during Weeks 1-6. I’ll also accept demonstrations of technical areas that are part of your Individual Game Project submission. You’ll be able to see on Avenue To Learn what level you’ve achieved in each of the 5 areas.</p>

<p>The 3 levels of technical achievement involve different levels of guidance (from me) and independence and responsibility (from you). For level 1, I’ll provide detailed step-by-step instructions for how to achieve it in each area of technical practice. For level 2, I’ll provide somewhat less detailed instructions (sometimes mostly in the form of comments on a template project that demonstrates the concepts). For level 3, I’ll provide only indications of some possible starting points, suggestions, and concepts to focus on. If you intend to explore and achieve level 3 in an area of technical practice, please discuss it with me as soon as you start working on this, so that we can aim at a shared understanding of the direction you are going in. Note also that to achieve level 2 you also need to demonstrate level 1, and that to achieve level 3 you also need to demonstrate levels 2 and 1. Here are zoomed out descriptions of the expectations for each level in each technical area (links to further details will be on Avenue):</p>

 
3D Assets 

    level 1: textured 3D models of real-world objects with collision shapes  

    level 2: rig and animate a character model with functioning walk/idle animations 

    level 3: generative textures, inverse kinematics, 3D scanning, motion capture, water, fire, mirrors, shader programming (or something else ambitious) 

  

2D User Interfaces (UI) 

    level 1: 2D titles, transitions, and overlays (e.g. score/HP display) 

    level 2: inventories and popup dialogues 

    level 3: animated UI (or something else ambitious) 

  

Sound 

    level 1: triggered sound effects and positional ambient sounds 

    level 2: sound banks with random/generative variation   

    level 3: adaptive sound tracks (or something else ambitious) 

  

Mechanics  

    level 1: collisions as triggers (maze transitions, collecting objects, scores) 

    level 2: objects that move (projectiles, moving terrain, following) 

    level 3: branching paths, co-evolving states (or something else ambitious) 

  

Camera and Control 

    level 1: 2D and almost 2D motion in 3D spaces  

    level 2: 1st-person with mouselook, keyboard, game controller, skybox, no edges   

    level 3: independent cameras, context-sensitive popups, temporary "loss of control", flight, swimming, scopes (or something else ambitious) 

 

Individual Game Project 

The individual game project is a complete tiny game, created with Godot and Blender, submitted by Fri 14 Feb at 10 PM and shared with the entire class during our in-person individual project showcase during our normal meeting time on Fri 28 Feb. I encourage you to consider making a game that explores the environmental/ecological gaming focus we’ll be developing, but this is just a suggestion (feel free to make the game you want to make). To receive credit for meeting the basic expectation of the course, each individual game project must: 

    be a complete, tiny, original game, created with Godot and Blender 

    be submitted as a Godot project folder inside a ZIP archive 

    include and emphasize originally created 3D assets 

    have functioning/playable mechanics, implemented from scratch with GDScript 

    include interactive sound elements 

    include 2D UI elements (such as title screens, menus, score/info displays, etc) 

    include documentation of any and all borrowed materials (including license terms) 

Projects that almost but don’t quite meet the requirements will be invited to resubmit, in advance of the individual showcase date. Although there is no requirement that a successful individual game project demonstrate competence in the 5 technical areas, you are free (as mentioned above) to use the individual game project to demonstrate competence in areas that haven’t been demonstrated through weekly submissions, as necessary. 

Please note also that any borrowed materials included in the project must either be explicitly available on a public domain basis, or under the terms of a clearly documented and applicable Creative Commons or free-and-open-source license. In other words, for the individual game project, materials cannot be included on a “fair use” basis. This is to ensure that your projects can be used as portfolio materials later on, and to practice thinking about such things as we head towards the collective game project. 

Collective Game Project 

The collective game project is a complete small (not tiny) game, created by the entire class, working together, with Godot and Blender. During Week 7 of the course, we will determine specific roles and responsibilities for every member of the class. Our weekly meetings in the second half of the semester will be entirely devoted to working together on this collective project, and it is expected that students will also work at least 2 hours per week independently (outside of class time) on their contributions to the game. After the game is completed, you will submit a portfolio documenting your specific, individual contributions (due Fri 11 Apr by 10 PM) and we’ll showcase it on campus, and at the Level Up Showcase. We’ll definitely be exploring the possibilities for this collective project to explore environmental and ecological themes (and there are many, many different ways those themes could be developed). 

Brief Analysis of a Game Detail 

During the first half of the course, you will be scheduled (via a sign up process during the first week of the course) to deliver a very short analysis of a game detail (a visual or sonic detail, or a game mechanic) you find interesting. Normally, you would do this via a brief post to our class Discord server during the week you signed up for. The purposes of this activity are (1) to focus our attention on the details of game designs, (2) to get comfortable sharing ideas about games with each other, and (3) to learn, as a team, what kind of things we are each interested in, so that all of that can inform the game we make together during the second half of the course. I encourage you to respond and engage with the details that others share! 

    -- OLD --

<p>The approach to assessment in this class is based on a combination of ideas from specifications grading and labour-based grading. Specifications grading (Nilson 2015) is an approach where grades are earned by submitting work that meets specific, objective, measurable criteria. Labour-based grading (Inoue 2019) is an approach to grading where grades are earned based on the quantity of work that is completed. Concretely: your grade is not the sum of my judgements about how well or how poorly I think something you made works; instead, your grade is the sum of points that you earn for successfully completing tasks (labour), and you will be just as capable as I of determining that something has successfully met the standard; moreover, for many (but not all) tasks, there will be the chance to resubmit work that did not meet the standard, for full credit.</p> 

<p>My motivation for taking this approach is two-fold: on the one hand, it is a matter of “epistemic peace” - an attempt to drastically limit the extent to which I deliver judgement on others’ ways of knowing and expressing themselves; on the other hand, it is also about encouraging you to take risks in the artistic work you produce in this class: have an idea for a project but are worried about pulling it off? Don’t let worries about the grade stop you – go for it!</p>

<p>Rest assured that you’ll still receive lots of qualitative feedback from me, and from your peers, and that feedback will DEFINITELY involve interpretation of, and response to, the artistic choices you make! And I encourage you to consider that feedback carefully, and to think about what you can learn from it. However, the nature of that interpretive feedback will have NOTHING to do with the grade you earn.</p>

<p>Here’s the overall picture of the labour we will do in this course, and how it earns points towards the final grade in the course: 
<ul>
<li>Up to 11 pts: Attendance and Weekly Reflective Logs (1 pt per week, during weeks 1-12)</li>  
<li>Up to 15 pts: Technical Milestones (6 milestones worth 3 points each, during weeks 1-6)</li>  
<li>Up to 10 pts: Reading Responses (6 responses worth 2 points each, during weeks 1-7)</li> 
<li>4 pts: Lightning Talk About a Game Detail (schedule TBD, talk during weeks 2-6)</li>  
<li>24 pts: Individual Game Project (due Monday 27 Feb)</li>  
<li>36 pts: Collective Game Project (work every week between Feb 28 and April 11)</li> 
<li>(100 points total)</li>
</ul></p>  

<p><em>Attendance and Weekly Reflective Logs: </em>These brief weekly logs ask you to pay attention to, and reflect upon, the nature of your work in this class. While answering the questions is one of the basic requirements for everyone in the class, how you answer the questions is not connected in any way to your grade in the course (as long as you do answer the questions). Be honest with yourself and with me. I will always read these reflections with interest and will sometimes respond to them in writing. Reflective logs are due each Friday at 10 PM, after attending our full-class meeting and completing whatever other independent work you do for this course during the week. It should usually take 5-10 minutes to complete a reflective log. The following is an example of the kinds of questions most of the logs ask you to answer:</p> 

<p>1. How many hours did you spend working on course requirements this week (including but not limited to time attending our full-class meetings)?</p>  
<p>2. On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is "barely engaged at all" and 5 is "highly engaged" how engaged were you during/with your work for this class this week?</p> 
<p>3. In this space, please provide a brief reflection (minimum 125 words, no maximum) on this week's work and learning in this course – both activities you completed independently, and those we did together in full-class meetings. Some things you might reflect on: when and where did you do the work and how did that impact your engagement or the results? If you were more or less engaged, why? What is the most memorable, or important, or surprising, or difficult, or enjoyable (etc) thing you/we did this week? What is something you are thinking about differently as a result of your/our work this week?</p>  

<p>In some weeks, there may be a few additional questions to answer. For example, at the beginning of the course, the log will ask you to introduce yourself to the teaching team, as well as reflect on the abilities and experiences you bring into this class – and I can guarantee that all of you do bring important abilities and experiences into this class.</p> 

<p>Note: these logs can only be completed for credit (1 point each) when you attended all of a given week’s full-class meeting (from the beginning to the very end) or have had a conversation with me (Dr. 0) about a specific absence that has led to an agreement about how the missed labour and participation will be made up. In the absence of such a timely conversation and agreement, reflections from those who do not attend the full-class meeting will not be awarded a point. A maximum of one reflective log per semester can be resubmitted (within 5 business days of the date of initial feedback from me) if it does not receive a point.</p>

<p><em>Technical Milestones: </em>During each of the first six weeks of the course, there is a technical milestone to complete. Each milestone involves doing some kind of practical, technical task with Blender (3D modeling) and/or Godot (game engine). In most cases, you should be able to complete the milestone during our full-class meeting on Tuesday. Nonetheless, to accommodate circumstances where people need just a little bit more time, the milestone is due before the end of the same week (Friday, 10 PM), after which time a late penalty will be applied. If the submitted work meets the stated specifications, then you’ll receive full credit (2 points) for that milestone. If it doesn’t meet all the stated specifications, then you won’t receive any points (yet) and will have one chance to resubmit by an extended deadline of 5 business days after the date of initial feedback from me (this potential for resubmission applies to all technical milestones). The schedule of Topics and Readings lists the basic task of each milestone, and full details will be available on Avenue and MacVideo.</p>

<p><em>Reading Responses: </em>Over the first seven weeks of the course, there are six required readings from scholarly literature in game studies (and adjacent fields). To earn 2 points, you will need to carefully read the assigned reading, and then prepare and submit a short, prose response (minimum 250 words) that emphasizes your personal, individual reception of the assigned reading. For example: What parts of the reading resonate with you? What are connections you can see to games, game dynamics, game features (etc) that you are particularly familiar with? What parts of the readings were more opaque or difficult for you? How do you think we should consider the ideas in the reading as we move towards working on a collective game project together? Responses that do not emphasize your personal, individual reception of the assigned reading, or responses that are too brief, will not receive any points. A maximum of one reading response per semester can be resubmitted (within 5 business days of the date of initial feedback from me) if it does not receive points. The due dates for the reading responses are indicated on the schedule of Topics and Readings (they are always on a Monday, at 10 PM).</p> 

<p><em>Lightning Talk About a Game Detail: </em>During the first half of the course, you will be scheduled (via a sign up process during the first week of the course) to deliver a 5-minute “lightning talk” about a game detail. The purposes of this activity are (1) to focus our attention on the details of game designs, (2) to get comfortable sharing ideas about games with each other, and (3) to learn, as a team, what kind of things we are each interested in. Here’s how the lightning talk goes: (1) you’ll identify a detail (of a 3D model, a mechanic, a UI element, or something else) of a game that you find interesting; (2) you’ll share a slide in advance via a shared slide presentation; (3) at the scheduled time you’ll talk to the class for 3-4 minutes about the detail and what you find interesting about it; (4) we’ll discuss it further as a group for a minute or so. For completing this individual class presentation at the scheduled time you will receive 4 points towards the final grade.</p>

<p><em>Individual Game Project: </em>The individual game project is a complete tiny game, created with Godot and Blender. Completing it successfully earns 24 points towards the final course grade. The following are the full specifications for the project, together with the number of points that are subtracted from 24 (to a minimum of 0) if the specification is not met:
<ul>  
<li>24 pts: The individual game project is a complete, tiny, original game, created with Godot and Blender, and submitted as a Godot project folder inside a ZIP archive</li> 
<li>8 pts: The game includes original visual assets (images and/or 3D models)</li> 
<li>8 pts: The game includes functioning mechanics, implemented from scratch with GDScript</li> 
<li>6 pts: The game includes 2D UI elements (such as menus, score/info displays, etc)</li>
<li>4 pts: The game includes original sound assets</li> 
<li>4 pts: Any and all borrowed materials are clearly documented as public domain, or available under the terms of a clearly documented and applicable Creative Commons license</li>
</ul> 

Submissions that meet some but not all of the specifications will have one chance to resubmit, with an extended deadline of 5 business days after the date of initial feedback from me. Everyone is expected to share their individual game in our in-class showcase during week 7.</p> 

<p><em>Collective Game Project: </em>The collective game project is a complete small (not tiny) game, created by the entire class, working together, with Godot and Blender. During Week 7 of the course, we will determine specific roles and responsibilities for every member of the class. Our weekly meetings in the second half of the semester will be entirely devoted to working together on this collective project, and it is expected that students will also work at least 2 hours per week independently (outside of class time) on their contributions to the game. A demonstrable record of regular contributions to the completion of this game project earns 36 points towards the final course grade. Contributions are documented by sharing them in the class Discord server.  Points for labour on the collective game project are earned as follows (if the total of points is greater than 36, points will be capped at 36 points):
<ul>
<li>6 pts: documented contribution during Week 7 (Feb 28 - Mar 6)</li> 
<li>6 pts: documented contribution during Week 8 (Mar 7 - Mar 13)</li>  
<li>6 pts: documented contribution during Week 9 (Mar 14 - Mar 20)</li>  
<li>6 pts: documented contribution during Week 10 (Mar 21 - Mar 27)</li>  
<li>6 pts: documented contribution to production of alpha-version (Mar 28 - Apr 3)</li>  
<li>6 pts: documented contribution to final week fixes/refinement (Apr 4 - April 10)</li>   
<li>3 pts: attend McMaster showcase of collective game (April 11)</li>
</ul>
</p> 

<p><em>Course Policy on Missed Work, Extensions, and Late Penalties: </em>If you encounter difficult circumstances (such as personal or family crises, physical or mental health challenges, difficulty meeting basic needs like food and shelter, etc) please communicate that to me as soon as possible, so that we can strategize about how course requirements might still be met under such circumstances. You don’t need to explain the nature of the difficulty, although I am happy to talk if it is helpful.</p>

<p>Generally: The late penalty is 10% of the assignment weight per business day (or partial business day). For example, something worth 24 points that is submitted a day late would receive 21.6 points instead (24 – 2.4). A business day, for these purposes, is a day that is not Saturday nor Sunday, is not on McMaster’s list of holidays, and is not a special day in an individual student’s cultural/religious background (please communicate with me about the latter if it becomes relevant).</p> 

<p>While I’m here and since we are talking about due dates... Have you been wondering why all of the due dates in this course outline (and on Avenue) are set at 10 PM? Because sleep is vital to our health and wellness! The 10 PM due dates are intended to communicate that, wherever possible, as a matter of healthy and sustainable working habits, we should plan to complete our work in a way that allows us to sleep during the night.</p>
