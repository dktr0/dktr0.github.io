# Hiking

This is just the beginning of an entry in my [web garden](/web-gardening/index.html) about hiking - just random thoughts/pieces of information connected to my experiences with it...

Random thought: I think my love of hiking was in part encouraged by my intense childhood reading and re-reading of The Lord of the Rings, which is basically a story in which they win a war by doing a lot of hiking. The denouement of it all is literally just Frodo and Sam hiking up a mountain and depositing something near the top.
