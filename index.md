Welcome to my web garden! I'm an artist programmer and researcher, based at the southwest corner of Lake Ontario (at McMaster University and Cootes Paradise, near Hamilton, about 60 km south of Toronto). I work as a Professor in [McMaster's Department of Communication Studies and Media Arts](https://csma.humanities.mcmaster.ca), where I coordinate the [Networked Imagination Laboratory (NIL)](https://nil.mcmaster.ca), and teach in our undergraduate and graduate programs.

Here are some of my interests: improvisation, audio, generative art/music/design, live coding, game design and studies, network music, computing and networking as an artistic medium, artist programmers and artist programming, free and open source software, laptop orchestras and audiovisual ensembles, DIY, sound studies, software studies, alternative grading, functional programming, programming language design, computational play, real-time strategy (RTS) games, game sound, sound synthesis, web audio, graphics programming, nostalgic computation, etc

Here are some quick links to the projects I think people are perhaps most likely to be looking for:

- [Punctual (audiovisual live coding language)](https://dktr0.github.io/Punctual)
- [LocoMotion (live coding language for dance, choreography, 3D avatars)](https://dktr0.github.io/LocoMotion)
- [Estuary (browser-based collaborative live coding platform)](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca)
- [Cybernetic Orchestra (open, live coding laptop orchestra)](https://nil.mcmaster.ca/cybOrch.html)
- [MEDIAART 3L03 Game Design course](/game-design-course/outline/index.html)

And here are some links to other materials I am collecting as this web garden takes shape:

- [List of every game I've ever played](/games/index.html)

Below this paragraph are some more detailed entries for various projects I've been involved with over the past 15 years or so. This material was part of the portfolio I submitted when I went up for promotion to Full Professor not too long ago, and I plan to move it around, move it elsewhere, as I develop this website more as a digital garden and less of an academic portfolio.

<p><em>estuary</em> (browser-based collaborative live coding platform):</p>
<p>Created as the primary outcome of two SSHRC grants, and the focus of ongoing development, Estuary is a zero-installation, web-based collaborative platform for audiovisual live coding, with a dual emphasis on supporting multiple live coding programming languages (in increasingly modular ways) and on enabling networked ensembles (whether across the same room, or around the world).</p>

<p><em>MEDIAART 3L03: Game Design</em></p>
<p>I proposed the course MEDIAART 3L03 as a new course in the Media Arts program, for 2014, and have taught it 4 times since then. In the second half of the semester, the class forms into a single team to work on a collective game together.</p>

<p><em>very long cat</em> (tabla and live coding duo):</p>
<p><a href="https://shawnmativetsky.com/">Shawn Mativetsky (tabla)</a> and I formed this duo in early 2015, to explore network music possibilities (improvising together while staying in Montr√©al and Hamilton respectively) and the possibilities of combining live coding with specific instrumental performance traditions. The name comes from <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/02/24/telegraph-cat/">a quote, misattributed to Einstein, once included in the UNIX 'fortune' program</a>, and suggested to us somehow (I forget how) by <a href="https://yaxu.org">Alex McLean</a>, regarding the nature of the radio: "You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat.  You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles.  Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there.  The only difference is that there is no cat."</p>

<p><em>daem0n</em> (guitar/live coding performance piece with autonomous agent):</p>
<p>In the piece Daem0n, I play guitar along with an autonomous agent that live codes the rest of the music, and sometimes I tweak the code it generates as well. I first created Daem0n in mid 2014, ahead of a series of performances in a mini "algorave" tour in the UK, and then continued to sporadically come back to the piece thereafter, making big changes to how it works and sounds (in the first version everything happened within <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a>, while in the last performed version SuperCollider was used for machine listening, <a href="http://tidalcycles.org/">TidalCycles</a> was used for live coding, and code generation and display was done with JavaScript in the browser). Inspired by the example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Lewis">George E. Lewis and Voyager</a>, I plan to cultivate the piece over the long term as an improvising partner in a relatively specific musical context/idiom.</p>
