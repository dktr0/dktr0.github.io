# Web/Digital Gardening

I first heard the term "Digital Gardening" at [the inaugural Causal Islands conference in Toronto during 2023](https://toronto2023.causalislands.com/?ref=causalislands.com), probably during [the featured talk by Maggie Appleton, "The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXkDaDDJjoA) (I was there giving [a talk/extended demo of live coding improvisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsNvlmXHTA)). I was excited to recognize in the concept a handle a for something I felt I had been slowly ambling towards for a long time, ever since putting up my first website at some point in my undergraduate studies in the mid 1990s. I knew right away it was something I wanted to do, to dig deeper into, and to share with others.
