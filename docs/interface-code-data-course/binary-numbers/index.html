    <h1><a href="../outline/index.html">MEDIAART 3D03</a>: Binary numbers</h1>
<p>A bit is something that has two possible values. For example &quot;yes/no&quot; &quot;on/off&quot; or - as we have all heard no doubt everywhere about computers and computer stuff &quot;0 or 1&quot;. So, if we have one bit, we can use that to represent (encode/decode) anything that has two possible states or values.</p>
<p>If we have two bits then there are four possible states or values: 00 01 10 and 11</p>
<p>If we have three bits then there are eight possible states or values: 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111</p>
<p>Binary numbers are a form of code (an encoding/decoding) that treats sets of bits as equivalent to specific numbers. A particularly simple and common binary number encoding is about translating from sets of bits (sets of 0s and 1s) to natural numbers (including 0). It usually works like this: The rightmost digit is worth 1 if it is a 1 or 0 if it is a 0. The next digit to the left is worth 2 if it is 1 or 0 if it is 0. The next digit to the left is worth 4 if it is a 1 or 0 if it is 0. The next digit would be worth 8, then the next 16, then the next 32, and so on.</p>
<p>Being able to &quot;read&quot; (to manually encode/decode) this kind of code is useful for a number of different reasons including (a) general comprehension of computing things, (b) reading/understanding things to do with text/character encoding, and (c) as a basis for understanding hexadecimal numbers (another code we'll learn that is also useful for both of the preceding reasons). Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>0011 = 3
1111 = 15
1111111 = 127
11111111 = 255
1111111111111111 = 65535
</code></pre>
<p>How do you convert a binary encoded number into our &quot;normal&quot; decimal numbers? You identify what each digit with a 1 is worth and add those values together.</p>
<p>How do you convert a &quot;normal&quot; decimal number into a binary encoding? Here's how I do it: take the natural numbers that are powers of 2 (e.g. 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1). Start with the biggest number that is less than the number you are encoding and mark that digit as &quot;present&quot; &quot;on&quot; &quot;1&quot; and subtract the number from what you are encoding. Now repeat this until nothing (0) is left.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">Wikipedia article about binary numbers</a> has some pretty cool historical reference points on the topic, from different cultural locations around the world and going back millennia!</p>
