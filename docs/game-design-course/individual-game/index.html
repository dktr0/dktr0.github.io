    <p><em>Individual Game</em></p>
<p>The individual game project is a complete tiny game, created with Godot and Blender, submitted by Fri 14 Feb at 10 PM and shared with the entire class during our in-person individual project showcase during our normal meeting time on Fri 28 Feb. I encourage you to consider making a game that explores the environmental/ecological gaming focus we’ll be developing, but this is just a suggestion (feel free to make the game you want to make). To receive credit for meeting the basic expectation of the course, each individual game project must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be a complete, tiny, original game, created with Godot and Blender</li>
<li>be submitted as a Godot project folder inside a ZIP archive</li>
<li>include and emphasize originally created 3D assets</li>
<li>have functioning/playable mechanics, implemented from scratch with GDScript</li>
<li>include interactive sound elements</li>
<li>include 2D UI elements (such as title screens, menus, score/info displays, etc)</li>
<li>include documentation of any and all borrowed materials (including license terms)</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects that almost but don’t quite meet the requirements will be invited to resubmit, in advance of the individual showcase date. Although there is no requirement that a successful individual game project demonstrate competence in the 5 technical areas, you are free (as mentioned above) to use the individual game project to demonstrate competence in areas that haven’t been demonstrated through weekly submissions, as necessary.</p>
<p>Please note also that any borrowed materials included in the project must either be explicitly available on a public domain basis, or under the terms of a clearly documented and applicable Creative Commons or free-and-open-source license. In other words, for the individual game project, materials cannot be included on a “fair use” basis. This is to ensure that your projects can be used as portfolio materials later on, and to practice thinking about such things as we head towards the collective game project.</p>
