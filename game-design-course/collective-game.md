# Collective Game

The collective game project is a complete small (not tiny) game, created by the entire class, working together, with Godot and Blender. During Week 7 of the course, we will determine specific roles and responsibilities for every member of the class. Our weekly meetings in the second half of the semester will be entirely devoted to working together on this collective project, and it is expected that students will also work at least 2 hours per week independently (outside of class time) on their contributions to the game. After the game is completed, you will submit a portfolio documenting your specific, individual contributions (due Fri 11 Apr by 10 PM) and we’ll showcase it on campus, and at the Level Up Showcase. We’ll definitely be exploring the possibilities for this collective project to explore environmental and ecological themes (and there are many, many different ways those themes could be developed).

# Additional Guidance

## About the portfolio of specific, individual contributions

A few additional notes about the portfolio submitted at the end of the collective game process:

- "Contribut[ing] regularly and substantially to our collective game project, AND submit[ting] a portfolio documenting your individual contributions" is one of the basic expectations of the course (completing the 3 basic expectations earns a base grade of B+/9)
- Please submit the portfolio in PDF format in the relevant Avenue submission folder
- Include copious images of work at various stages and note the dates when relevant work was completed/updated/etc
- Include brief text commentary that helps explain the images (etc) - such as explaining how/why you came to be working on that thing at that point in time
- Please consider mentioning and naming peers in the text when they provided critical assistance or insight relevant to your contributions
- Note that the timing of work is important in a collaborative project like this. Work that arrives too late in the process to be meaningfully incorporated into the actual game is not so helpful. The best way to have a strong portfolio of contributions is to contribute early and regularly to the collective work.

## Things to definitely DO during the collective game project

- DO attend every full-class meeting from the beginning to the end
- DO new work in between the meetings (and not only at the last minute before Friday's meeting)
- DO make every possible effort to produce things that align aesthetically/mechanically with overall project
- DO look at/listen/observe what the rest of the team is doing and respond to it
- DO pay attention to how big models/files/images are and keep things as small as possible
- DO upload/contribute updated materials as frequently as soon as they are available
- DO work in an up-to-date copy of the class Godot project (in your named folder within that project)
- DO update our shared current task spreadsheet as you start/finish specific tasks for the team 
- DO keep a diary/screenshot archive of individual work as it progresses for the final portfolio submission 
- DO reach out to me (Dr. 0) and your peers frequently, mostly in the team channels on our Discord

## Things to NOT DO during the collective game project

- DON'T do things / make decisions / etc that belong to other teams (communicate/consult instead)
- DON'T hold up work waiting for clarification (use placeholders; do other useful things; etc)
- DON'T use any borrowed materials (except in narrow, very carefully considered cases)
- DON'T use any AI generated materials
- DON'T contribute random/irrelevant/not newly made/etc things in an attempt to "look busy"

## git and github guidance

(Coming soon after some initial discussion between Dr. 0, and the programming and level design teams.)
