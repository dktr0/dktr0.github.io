# Brief Analysis of a Game Detail

During the first half of the course, you will be scheduled (via a sign up process during the first week of the course) to deliver a very short analysis of a game detail (a visual or sonic detail, or a game mechanic) you find interesting. Normally, you would do this via a brief post to our class Discord server during the week you signed up for. The purposes of this activity are (1) to focus our attention on the details of game designs, (2) to get comfortable sharing ideas about games with each other, and (3) to learn, as a team, what kind of things we are each interested in, so that all of that can inform the game we make together during the second half of the course. I encourage you to respond and engage with the details that others share!
