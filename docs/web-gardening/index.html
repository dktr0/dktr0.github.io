    <h1>Web/Digital Gardening</h1>
<p>I first heard the term &quot;Digital Gardening&quot; at <a href="https://toronto2023.causalislands.com/?ref=causalislands.com">the inaugural Causal Islands conference in Toronto during 2023</a>, probably during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXkDaDDJjoA">the featured talk by Maggie Appleton, &quot;The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI&quot;</a> (I was there giving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsNvlmXHTA">a talk/extended demo of live coding improvisation</a>). I was excited to recognize in the concept a handle a for something I felt I had been slowly ambling towards for a long time, ever since putting up my first website at some point in my undergraduate studies in the mid 1990s. I knew right away it was something I wanted to do, to dig deeper into, and to share with others.</p>
