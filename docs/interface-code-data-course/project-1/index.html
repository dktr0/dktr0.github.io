    <h1><a href="../outline/index.html">MEDIAART 3D03</a>: Project 1</h1>
<h1>Project Requirements</h1>
<p>The purpose of the first project in this course is to explore the six areas/learning outcomes in a smaller-scale, individual project, to be completed by 10 PM on Fri 13 Feb, and to be showcased for the whole class during our class meeting on Mon 23 Feb.</p>
<p>The requirements of project #1 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>it must take the form of a self-contained (no server-side features) website (partying like it's 1999)</li>
<li>it must be authored using a text editor, with no copy-pasting or code generation</li>
<li>it must be implemented with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
<li>it must engage somehow (potentially very loosely) with any of the ideas we've discussed in connection with one or more of the &quot;Codes&quot;, &quot;Web Pasts, Presents, Futures&quot;, and &quot;Generative Art and Live Coding&quot;</li>
<li>it must be submitted as a self-contained folder with index.html as the starting page</li>
<li>the self-contained folder must be compressed into a ZIP archive (no other formats, please) and submitted to the relevant folder on Avenue</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects that meet all of the above requirements will count as &quot;ACHIEVED&quot; for the purposes of the final grade. Projects that are submitted in good faith (i.e. clearly represent a substantial quantity of work aimed at the requirements) but which do not quite meet the requirements will be given the chance to RESUBMIT within one calendar week of the date on which feedback is given (normally within 2 weeks of submission), up until the date of the final exam (TBD) after which no further resubmissions are possible.</p>
<p>It's quite important that you write the code yourself for this project. Iterative, direct contact with code that you write, read, and change yourself is the best way to learn about how that code works (and thus also good preparation for the final exam in this course). In addition to the time we'll spend hacking together on things in our class meetings, I am always happy to meet with people outside of class to think about project challenges, strategize about how projects can be kept manageable and realizable, etc.</p>
