    <h1><a href="../outline/index.html">MEDIAART 3D03</a>: The web of the 1990s</h1>
<p>As is so often the case in Web matters, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">the Wikipedia article about the World Wide Web is a good starting point and reference</a>.</p>
<p>1989 is the usual date given for it, so a bit ahead of Gopher but essentially overlapping with it (and I think it shows how ideas of this sort were kind of in the air in that moment / had been percolating for a while, c.f. the discussion of hypertext and hyperlinks in other and earlier systems in the above Wikipedia article).</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish the history (and function) of the &quot;Web&quot; from that of the &quot;Internet&quot;, even though those two terms are sometimes conflated in everyday discourse.</p>
<p>What were the key parts of the world wide web back in the early 1990s?</p>
<ul>
<li>http protocol (hyper-text transfer protocol: describing how web documents are requested/transmitted), including the basic structure of URLs (describing how web documents are &quot;located&quot;)</li>
<li>the HTML &quot;language&quot; (describing the &quot;content&quot; of web documents)</li>
<li>the earliest web browsers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb">WorldWideWeb/Nexus (1990)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViolaWWW">ViolaWWW (1991)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">Mosaic (1993)</a></li>
<li>the first web server, httpd (1990)</li>
</ul>
<p>What were the parts of the world wide web that came somewhat later?</p>
<ul>
<li>cascading style sheets (CSS, 1994-6)</li>
<li>JavaScript (1995)</li>
<li>the https protocol (1994, but with a very gradual adoption over the following 2-3 decades) which encrypts all of the things that are not encrypted in the original http protocol</li>
<li>standardized, specialized web APIs (&quot;application programming interfaces&quot;) for all kinds of things that happen inside web browsers nowadays (video calls, audio programming, etc etc etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Netscape Navigator, late 1994/early 1995 (and by a circuitous process &quot;becomes&quot; Mozilla Firefox, decades later)</p>
<p>Internet Explorer, included &quot;free of charge&quot; with Windows 1995</p>
